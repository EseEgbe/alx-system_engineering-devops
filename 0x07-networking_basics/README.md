# 0x07. Networking basics #0
Project done during Software Engineering program at ALX.
It aims to learn about OSI model, LAN, WAN, IP address, localhost, subnet and TCP/UDP.

## Technologies
* Scripts are written in Bash 5.2.15
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Learning Objectives
Learning points in this project include:

* What it is an OSI Model, how many layers does it have and how is it organized
* What is a LAN, it's typical usage and typical geographical size
* What is a WAN, it's typical usage and typical geographical size
* What is the Internet
* What is an IP address, what are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost, what is a subnet
* Why was IPv6 created
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
